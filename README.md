# Bike Store Profits

**Tools Used: MySQL, Tableau**

**Data Used:** [Bike Store Relational Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database)

**Plan of Action:** We will use MySQL to import and join the relational data to find the following KPIs by store: number of orders, sales, COG, OpEx, and profits. By doing this, we can gain insight on which stores are performing the best and take action to imporve lagging stores. We will also evaluate sales by product category to ensure we are properly allocating store space. Furthermore, we will look at order sales by location to see if a second shop shop should be opened
