# Bike Store Profits

**Tools Used: MySQL, Tableau**

**Data Used:** [Bike Store Relational Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dillonmyrick/bike-store-sample-database)

**Plan of Action:** Using MySQL we can import and join the relational data to find the following KPIs by store: number of orders, sales, COG, OpEx, and profits. This will give insight on which stores are performing the best and if action is needed to imporve lagging stores. We will also evaluate sales by product category and zip code to ensure we are properly allocating store space and to see if another shop should be opened.

**Business Insights:** It is shown that New York is by far the most profitable store with 2.595 M in profits from January 2016 to April 2018. This represents a monthly profit of $92,678 but it can be shown that the business is increasingly profitabe with each year. The last month of data (April 2018) was by far the most profitable month for each store due to increased sales. If the drastic spike in sales was caused by a promotion or increased advertising, we must track this data to analyze the effectiveness of money spent on advertisements. This should be monitored on a weekly basis incase certain ads or advertising platforms begin to be less effective over time.
